  <h2>The Development Phase</h2>

<p>The key stages in the development phase are:</p>

  <ul class="process-chart">
    <li><a href="#">Team formation / kickoff meeting</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">User Research</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Design Sprint(s)</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Development Sprints</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Deploy Prototype</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Test and Learn</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Launch</a></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Team formation / kickoff meeting</H3>
<p>Now we have a contract and are ready to get started we need to pull together the internal project team.</p>

<p>On every project Informatics will field at least a <a href="#">Product Manager</a>, a <a href="#">UX Designer</a>, and a <a href="#">Lead Developer</a>. Generally we try and make sure there are at least two developers working on a project, unless it's a really small project.</p>

<p>This first kickoff meeting is to introduce all the stakeholders involved in the project to eachother, and go over how the project will play out. If there are lots of external stakeholders we might hold an internal kick-off prior to the main externally facing kick-off meeting.</p>

<p>Specifically, during this meeting we will want to: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Present the project as it's currently understood</li>
  <li>Clarify with funders / stakeholders what our understanding of the main goals of the project are, and what the key success criteria are (the Product Manager will lead on this and has some techniques for drawing out answers)</li>
  <li>Specify what demands on their time we are going to make (and get commitment from them for this time)</li>
  <li>Define core user groups (this may require further research)</li>
  <li>Identify a list of (or a route to getting a list of) end users of the product so we can plan for the UX stage</li>
</ul>

<p>After this meeting (and every other meeting with funders / stakholders), the Product Manager will send an email to all funders / stakeholders repeating key points and actions from the meeting, and specifically asking for any corrections.</p>

<p class="warning">ðŸš©<b>Warning:</b> if at this stage key stakeholders sound like they are not going to be very responsive to requests, or are unable to regularly attend sceduled project calls it's extremely important to flag this with them as a problem for the project.</p>

<h3>User Research</h3>
