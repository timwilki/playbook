      <h2>How We Work</h2>

      <p>These 6 plays form the foundation of how we aim to deliver more successful projects. They are drawn from established successful practices of both the private and public sector.</p>

<ol>
<li><h4>Understand what people need<span>Every project must start by exploring the needs and problems of the people who will use the application (note that this is probably not the funders!)</span></h4></li>
<li><h4>Make it simple and intuitive <span>Better to have multiple apps that do different things brilliantly, than one app that does everything badly</span></h4></li>
<li><h4>Build using agile and iterative practices<span>Get the product in the hands of users as early as possible, so we can learn fast and have the best chance of success</span></h4></li>
<li><h4>Choose a modern technology stack and default to open<span>We need to work efficiently and openely, building maintainable and scaleable applications, avoiding vendor lock-in, and enabling other teams to extend and iterate on our work</span></h4></li>
<li><h4>Make decisions based on data, not supposition<span>At every stage of the project we should establish processes and metrics which enable us to use data to guide and evidence development and design decision making</span></h4></li>
<li><h4>Involve all stakeholders throughout the project<span>Projects are successful when everyone in the team engages and plays an active role in decision making. In this case, the 'team' means everyone with a stake in the outcome of the project, from the developers to the project sponsor and the ultimate users of the application</span></h4></li>
</ol>

<p>Skipping any one of these plays puts the successful delivery of the project at significant risk.</p>
