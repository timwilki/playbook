  <h2>Project Scoping</h2>

<p>It's really important that everyone properly understands a project before committing to it. We need to make sure we have an accurate grasp of the risks and parameters of a project. Are we the best people to do it? Has it already been done elsewhere? Can we do a good job given the budget or time constraints?</p>

<p>This phase is designed to answer those questions, and make sure everyone sets off in the right direction.</p>

<h4>Project scoping involves the following activities</h4>

  <ul class="process-chart">
    <li><a href="#">New Project Request</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Project Scoping</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">The Estimate</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Go / No Go decision</a></li>
  </ul>

<h3>New Project Request</h3>
<p>New projects should start with the <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/UaPv1A6BvB">new projects request form</a></p>

<p>This is a quick structured way for us to collect all the key initial details about your project such as timeframes, outline budgets and stakeholders</p>

<p>Completing the form will trigger the Head of Informatics to assign a <a href="informatics-roles.html">product manager</a> to the project, and arrange a meeting with you to learn a bit more about the project, and ultimately whether we can help.</p>

<h3>Project Scopting Meeting</h3>

<p>The project scoping meeting is generally an hour long meeting with you to understand your project in more detail.</p>


<h4>The goal of this meeting is to:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how developed the concept is</li>
<li>Talk about timescales &amp; budgets vs expectations of clients</li>
<li>Identify key stakeholders</li>
<li>Identify risks</li>
<li>Identify dependencies and limitations (eg. needs to be written in Java and delivered for the COP in September)</li>
<li>Is there anything else out there that does the same/similar?</li>
<li>Explain our processes and why we work this way</li>
<li>Set the relationship expectations (e.g will stakeholders be available for feedback)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>From this information we'll be able to develop an outline time and cost estimate.</p>

<h3>The Estimate</h3>
<p>Following the project scoping meeting the Informatics team will have enough information to provide an outline estimate for the work.</p>

<h4>A little bit about estimation in software development...</h4>
<p>A huge amount has been written about the difficulties of estimating accurately in software development, and along with civil engineering, software development projects hold the honour of being most likely to go over budget.</p>

<p>This is because itâ€™s impossible to consider all the elements upfront. Often itâ€™s not until you start to click through an application that you identify things that need to be done, or find opportunities to improve on what was initially specified. Itâ€™s also because all the various people involved in a project will have a slightly different idea of whatâ€™s being built. This generally isnâ€™t evident until the concept is made tangible and project partners can actually see the application and discuss how it differs from what they wanted!</p>

<p>To add to that, generally the work we do here has an experimental element. Weâ€™re building complex GIS and data applications so, irrespective of how capable the team are, we often come across challenging development problems (thatâ€™s partly what makes the job fun!). Humans are generally terrible at estimating, and get worse the less experience they have of something, so if weâ€™re developing an entirely new component itâ€™s unlikely weâ€™ll get the estimate correct.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also important to think about contingency, and fluctuate this depending on elements of risk. Risk can come in many forms, but some of the things we look out for are:
<ul>
<li>Whether or not weâ€™ve worked with a particular funder / partner before (and if we have, were they a â€˜goodâ€™ partner)</li>
<li>Poor definition of objectives for the project</li>
<li>A very complex project with lots of features</li>
<li>A project where the funder / partner is focussed on features rather than outcomes / goals</li>
<li>Potential cultural challenges</li>
<li>Lack of engagement / evidence that weâ€™re going to struggle to get timely, regular feedback from funders / partners / key stakeholders</li>
<li>Requests to work in technologies weâ€™re not familiar with</li>
<li>Requests to work with other dev teams (it could be a great experience, but there are added overheads)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We will always give an estimate for the full amount of work required. If the estimate is too high for the budget the only way to reduce the cost will be to remove features, or totally rethink the scope to try and match a solution (which meets the project's goals), to the budget.</p>

<p>If this happens and the funder / partner has already seen the estimate, it needs to be made clear how weâ€™ve reduced the cost so they understand what's different, and donâ€™t think theyâ€™re getting the same thing at a discount!</p>

<h3>The "Go / No Go decision"</h3>
<p>This is the last stage in the scoping phase.</p>
<p>We really want to work on as many great projects as possible. However, it's really important that we work on projects that are going to deliver value, and under conditions in which we have a sporting chance of doing a great job.</p>
<p>Therefor, there are some circumstances where we might advise working with another team, or not doing the project at all.</p>
<p>For example:
<ul>
  <li>It might require the use of a specialist technology we're not familiar with</li>
  <li>The problem might already have been solved by someone else</li>
  <li>Other teams might be better placed to do the work depending on the conditions of the project</li>
  <li>We might feel the time or budget constraints mean it's unlikly we'll be able to complete the project successfully</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If we don't think it's a good idea to work on a project, we'll help you find someone who can, or work with you to find alternative solutions</p>
