      <h2>Project Scoping</h2>

<p>The project scoping meeting is generally an hour long meeting with you to understand your project in more detail.</p>


<h3>The goal of this meeting is to:</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how developed the concept is</li>
<li>Talk about timescales &amp; budgets vs expectations of clients</li>
<li>Identify key stakeholders</li>
<li>Identify risks</li>
<li>Identify dependencies and limitations (eg. needs to be written in Java)</li>
<li>Is there anything else out there that does the same/similar?</li>
<li>Explain our processes and why we work this way</li>
<li>Set the relationship expectations (we will work hard, and expect you to...)</li>
</ul>
</p>
